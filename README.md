Connect Four is a web-based, two-player strategy game modeled off the real life board game.

## Features
* Gameplay based off real Connect 4 rules:
  * Each player takes turns dropping a token into their desired column of the game board
  * When one player lines up four tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, they win the game!
  * Players alternate who goes first with each round
* Players can customize their name and their token color
* Responsive design makes it easily playable on any size screen
